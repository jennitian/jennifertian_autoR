# Autos R Us Mecha Car Analysis
module 15 challenge

## Goals
Using data on mecha car prototypes and suspension coil tests, I look at which factors influence fuel efficiency (mpg) in the cars and whether there is consistency across the manufacturers of these vehicles based on variance in the suspension tests. I did this using various statistical methods in R

## Findings
Detailed findings from this analysis can be found in the MechaCarWriteUp.txt file. Further tests are also recommended for these cars before they are taken to market.
